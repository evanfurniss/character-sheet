# Character Sheet

## Overview

This is currently a dice rolling app that allows you to input in the number of dice, the size of the dice, and any modifiers. The output displays both the base roll and the total including modifiers, important for natural 1's and 20's.

Soon, I would like to add the ability to add an inventory, maintain stats, apply modifiers instantly to dice rolls, and track any other character sheet features.
